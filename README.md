## What I Do  
I build visualizations and that help journalists, analysts and the public make sense of political and economic data.

* **Gather & simplify** messy & complex public data (e.g., campaign finance, polling, media coverage, foreign assistance, public websites)  
* **Visualize & publish** interactive dashboards, maps, and data graphics to create memorable takeaways   
* **Collaborate & iterate** with journalists, academics, and the public. Improve products and keep them up to date over time
