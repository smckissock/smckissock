## What I Do  
I build data pipelines and visualizations that help journalists, analysts and the public explore political and economic data.

* **Gather & simplify** messy & complex public data (e.g., campaign finance, polling, media coverage, public websites)  
* **Visualize & publish** interactive dashboards, portals, and graphics to create takeaways from complex data   
* **Collaborate & iterate** with journalists, experts and the public. Refresh data and improve products updated over time
